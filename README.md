# Specter
Specter is a stealthy, terminal-based post-exploitation framework , built for deep system interaction, persistence, and network reconnaissance — all from a simple shell.
# Specter 🕶️  
> *"A whisper in the wires."*  

**Specter** is a stealthy, terminal-based post-exploitation framework for Linux. Designed for deep system-level control, persistence, and silent reconnaissance within a LAN or remote network environment. Built in Python, Specter is meant to be a learning journey into the art of system exploitation, evasion, and control.

## 🚧 Project Status

Specter is currently in **active development**. The goal is to build it in phases, improving both features and stealth capabilities over time.  
Stay tuned for updates and milestone logs. This is a **long-term project** built to learn and experiment — not a ready-to-use weapon.

## 🧠 Key Features (Planned / In Progress)

- [✅] LAN reverse shell connection
- [ ] Remote internet access via Ngrok or DDNS
- [ ] File upload/download
- [ ] Privilege escalation modules (enum + exploitation)
- [✅] Persistence across reboots
- [ ] Screenshot / keystroke logging
- [ ] Terminal UI or lightweight dashboard
- [✅] Modular plugin system for tools

## 📦 Tech Stack

- **Python 3**
- `socket`, `subprocess`, `os`, `psutil`, `requests`
- Compatible with **Linux** (Windows support later)
- Optional support for **Ngrok/Cloudflare Tunnel** in future versions

## 🧪 Learning Goals

This project is not about speed — it’s about learning. Some core areas I’ll explore:
- Socket programming
- Linux internals & privilege escalation
- Persistence techniques
- Secure C2 (Command & Control) communication
- System enumeration & evasion
- Ethical hacking principles

## 🚀 Follow the Journey

This project will be developed in **phases**, with major updates and thoughts shared along the way.  
It’ll take **months** — but I’m here for the long haul.

If you’re into low-level Linux hacking, Python, or stealthy networking — stay tuned. ✌️
